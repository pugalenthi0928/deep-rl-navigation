# Deep RL for Autonomous Navigation ðŸš€

This project trains a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to **navigate a 5Ã—5 grid-world** using visual input.

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to process visual input.
- Implements **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** for reinforcement learning.
- Trains an AI agent to **navigate a grid and reach a goal**.

## ðŸ“Œ Installation
```bash
pip install torch
